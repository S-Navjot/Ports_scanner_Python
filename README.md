# Python Port Scanner  

This project is a Python script that allows you to scan the ports of a specified IP address. The script uses the `socket` library to establish connections and determine the status of ports, as well as `ThreadPoolExecutor` to perform port scanning in parallel.

## Features  

- Scan ports of an IP address (IPv4)
- Utilizes parallelization to speed up the scan
- Displays open ports

## Installation  

### Prerequisites  

- Python 3.x must be installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation Steps  

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/S-Navjot/Ports_scanner_Python.git

### Usage Steps    

Open the Terminal
```sh
$ cd Ports_scanner_Python
$ python3 main.py
```

1. Enter the IPv4 Address you want to scan  
2. Enter first port to scan  
3. Enter last port to scan
